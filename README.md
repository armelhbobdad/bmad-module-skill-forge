---

SKF is a standalone BMAD module that provides a single expert agent (Ferris, Skill Architect & Integrity Guardian) and ten workflows spanning source analysis, skill briefing, AST-backed compilation, integrity testing, and ecosystem-ready export across progressive capability tiers (Quick/Forge/Deep).

## Why SKF

- AST-verified instructions with line-level provenance — no hallucinated guidance
- Progressive capability model that meets developers where they are
- Full lifecycle: discover, brief, compile, test, audit, update, export
- Version-pinned skills that track source changes and detect drift
- Zero hallucination tolerance — every instruction traces to code

## How BMad Works

BMad works because it turns big, fuzzy work into **repeatable workflows**. Each workflow is broken into small steps with clear instructions, so the AI follows the same path every time. It also uses a **shared knowledge base** (standards and patterns) so outputs are consistent, not random. In short: **structured steps + shared standards = reliable results**.

## How SKF Fits In

SKF plugs into BMad the same way a specialist plugs into a team. It uses the same step-by-step workflow engine and shared standards, but focuses exclusively on skill compilation and quality assurance. That means you get **evidence-based agent skills**, **AST-verified instructions**, and **drift detection** that align with the rest of the BMad process.

## Architecture & Flow

BMad is a small **agent + workflow engine**. There is no external orchestrator — everything runs inside the LLM context window through structured instructions.

### Building Blocks

Each workflow directory contains these files, and each has a specific job:

| File | What it does | When it loads |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `forger.agent.yaml` | Expert persona — identity, principles, critical actions, menu of triggers | First — always in context |
| `workflow.md` | Human-readable entry point — goals, mode menu (Create/Edit/Validate), routes to first step | Second — presents mode choice |
| `steps-c/*.md` | **Create** steps — primary execution, 4-9 sequential files | One at a time (just-in-time) |
| `data/*.md` | Workflow-specific reference data — schemas, heuristics, rules, patterns | Read by steps on demand |
| `templates/*.md` | Output skeletons with placeholder vars — steps fill these in to produce the final artifact | Read by steps when generating output |
| `skf-knowledge-index.csv` | Knowledge fragment index — id, name, tags, tier, file path | Read by steps to decide which fragments to load |
| `knowledge/*.md` | 8 reusable fragments — cross-cutting principles and patterns (e.g., `zero-hallucination.md`, `confidence-tiers.md`) | Selectively read into context when a step directs |

  S --> D[Data & Templates<br/>data/*.md, templates/*.md]
  S --> O[Outputs: skills/reports<br/>when a step writes output]
```

### How It Works at Runtime

1. **Trigger** — User types `@Ferris CS` (or fuzzy match like `create-skill`). The agent menu in `forger.agent.yaml` maps the trigger to the workflow path.
2. **Agent loads** — `forger.agent.yaml` injects the persona (identity, principles, critical actions) into the context window. Sidecar files (`forge-tier.yaml`, `preferences.yaml`) are loaded for persistent state.
3. **Workflow loads** — `workflow.md` presents the mode choice and routes to the first step file.
4. **Step-by-step execution** — Only the current step file is in context (just-in-time loading). Each step explicitly names the next one. The LLM reads, executes, saves output, then loads the next step. No future steps are ever preloaded.
5. **Knowledge injection** — Steps consult `skf-knowledge-index.csv` and selectively load fragments from `knowledge/` by tags and relevance. Cross-cutting principles (zero hallucination, confidence tiers, provenance) are loaded only when a step directs — not preloaded.
6. **Data injection** — Steps read `data/*.md` files as needed (schemas, heuristics, extraction patterns). This is deliberate context engineering: only the data relevant to the current step enters the context window.
7. **Templates** — When a step produces output (e.g., a skill brief or test report), it reads the template file and fills in placeholders with computed results. The template provides consistent structure; the step provides the content.
8. **Progress tracking** — Each step appends to an output file with state tracking. Resume mode reads this state and routes to the next incomplete step.

### Ferris Operating Modes

Ferris operates in four workflow-driven modes (mode is determined by which workflow is running, not conversation state):

| Mode | Workflows | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Architect** | AN, BS, SF | Exploratory, assembling — discovers structure and scope |
| **Surgeon** | CS, QS, SS, US | Precise, preserving — extracts and compiles with provenance |
| **Audit** | AS, TS | Judgmental, scoring — evaluates quality and detects drift |
| **Delivery** | EX | Packaging, ecosystem-ready — bundles for distribution |

## Install

There are three ways to install SKF, depending on your setup.

### Method 1: Standalone (recommended for trying SKF)

```bash
npx bmad-module-skill-forge install
```

Installs SKF on its own. You'll be prompted for project name, output folders, and which IDEs to configure. The installer generates IDE-specific command files (e.g. `.claude/commands/`, `.cursor/commands/`) so workflows appear in your IDE's command palette.

### Method 2: As a custom module during BMad Method installation

```bash
npx bmad-method install
```

When prompted **"Add custom modules from your computer?"**, select Yes and provide the path to the SKF `src/` folder (clone this repo first):

```
Path to custom module folder: /path/to/bmad-module-skill-forge/src/
```

This installs BMad core + SKF together with full IDE integration, manifests, and help catalog. Best when you want the complete BMad development workflow.

### Method 3: Add SKF to an existing BMad project

If you already have BMad installed, you can add SKF afterward by running the standalone installer in the same directory:

```bash
npx bmad-module-skill-forge install
```

The installer detects the existing `_bmad/` directory and installs SKF alongside your current modules. IDE command files are generated for SKF workflows.

## Quickstart

1. **Setup your forge:** `@Ferris SF` — detects tools, sets your tier (Quick/Forge/Deep)
2. **Quick skill (fastest):** `@Ferris QS <package-name>` — fast skill from a package name
3. **Full skill:** `@Ferris BS` then `@Ferris CS` — brief then compile for maximum quality
4. **Stack skill:** `@Ferris SS` — consolidated project stack skill with integration patterns
5. **Export:** `@Ferris EX` — package for distribution, update CLAUDE.md

## Workflows

| Trigger | Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SF | `skf_setup_forge` | Initialize forge environment, detect tools, set tier |
| AN | `skf_analyze_source` | Discover what to skill in a large repo |
| BS | `skf_brief_skill` | Design a skill scope through guided discovery |
| CS | `skf_create_skill` | Compile a skill from brief (supports --batch) |
| QS | `skf_quick_skill` | Fast skill from package name or GitHub URL |
| SS | `skf_create_stack_skill` | Consolidated project stack skill with integration patterns |
| US | `skf_update_skill` | Smart regeneration preserving \[MANUAL\] sections |
| AS | `skf_audit_skill` | Drift detection between skill and current source |
| TS | `skf_test_skill` | Cognitive completeness verification — quality gate before export |
| EX | `skf_export_skill` | Package for distribution, inject into CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md |

## Progressive Capability Model

| Tier | Tools | Capability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Quick** | gh + skill-check | Source reading + spec validation |
| **Forge** | + ast-grep | Structural truth, T1 confidence |
| **Deep** | + QMD | Knowledge search, temporal provenance |

The `setup-forge` workflow detects available tools and writes the tier to `forge-tier.yaml`. All subsequent workflows adapt their behavior to the detected tier.

## Knowledge Base

SKF relies on a curated skill compilation knowledge base:

- Index: `src/knowledge/skf-knowledge-index.csv`
- Fragments: `src/knowledge/`

Workflows load only the fragments required for the current task to stay focused and compliant.

## Configuration

SKF variables are defined in `src/module.yaml` and prompted during install:

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `skills_output_folder` | Where generated skills are saved | `{project-root}/skills` |
| `forge_data_folder` | Where workspace artifacts are stored | `{project-root}/forge-data` |

Runtime configuration (tool detection, tier, parallel settings) is managed by the `setup-forge` workflow in `forge-tier.yaml`.
